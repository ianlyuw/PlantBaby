# Project README - Plant Search and Pet Toxicity Checker

This project leverages the Perenual.com API as its primary data source. The main functionality of this application centers around a search bar that enables users to quickly access information about various plant species. Here's an overview of what this project entails:

# Functions
<ins>Search Functionality:

Users can input search queries into the search bar.
The application will return a list of plant species that match the search query in either the scientific name or common name, providing a comprehensive search experience. 

<ins>Pet Toxicity Indicator:

For each plant species listed in the search results, the application provides a clear indication of whether the plant is toxic to pets.
This feature is designed to help users make informed decisions about the safety of plants around their pets.
# How it Works
The project uses data from Perenual.com as its primary data source.
When a user submits a search query, the application queries the Perenual.com API to retrieve relevant information about plant species.
The search results are then displayed to the user, including both the scientific and common names of the plants.
Additionally, the application provides a "yes" or "no" indicator for each plant to inform users of its toxicity to pets.
# Usage
<ins>Search for Plants:

Simply enter a search query into the provided search bar.
The application will display a list of plant species that match your query.

<ins>Check Pet Toxicity:

Alongside each plant species in the search results, you will find a "Toxic to Pets" indicator.
Use this indicator to assess the safety of plants in the presence of pets.
